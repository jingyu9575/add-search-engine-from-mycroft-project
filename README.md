# Add Search Engine from Mycroft Project
Provide a workaround to add search engines from Mycroft Project after Firefox 65.

Firefox 65 removed the non-standard feature that Mycroft Project relies on, preventing it from installing search engines. This extension provides a workaround to install search engines from it.

When clicking a search engine link from Mycroft Project, an installation page will show. Click the "â‹¯" menu in the address bar, and select "Add Search Engine".
